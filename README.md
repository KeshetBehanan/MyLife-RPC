# MyLife (Discord RPC)

MyLife is RPC (Rich Presence Client) for Discord.

It's a personal software which everyone can easily download and use (not only for games, and not for developers only!)

The software allows you to save templates, and use them later :smile:

The software developed by `KeshetBehanan#6796` (my Discord user).

2. Unzip the file.

3. Open `MyLifeRPC.exe` file.
